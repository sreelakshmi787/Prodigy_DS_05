# Traffic Accident Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of traffic accidents to identify patterns related to **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**. Through data visualization, the project highlights accident hotspots, common contributing factors, and relationships between accidents and external conditions.

## Project Motivation
Understanding traffic accident trends can help in:
- Identifying high-risk areas and times of day
- Making data-driven recommendations for improving road safety
- Developing awareness about the impact of weather on accident rates

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - US Traffic Accident Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)
- **Content**: Contains data on accident occurrences, including **latitude**, **longitude**, **time**, **city**, **state**, and **temperature**.
- **Preprocessing**: Focused on relevant columns (e.g., start time, city, temperature) and handled any missing or irrelevant data.

## Key Findings
- **Peak Accident Hours**: Certain hours of the day have higher accident rates, possibly correlating with rush hours.
- **Temperature Impact**: Extreme temperatures may lead to more accidents, highlighting the need for caution in adverse weather.
- **High-Risk Locations**: Some cities and states consistently report more accidents, making them potential targets for safety improvements.

## Instructions to Run
1. **Install Required Libraries**:
2. **Run the Code**:
   - Clone the repository and load the dataset.
   - Execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook (or script) to view preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with predictive models to forecast accident likelihood based on conditions.
- Incorporate additional external data, such as **weather forecasts** or **traffic flow data**, for more context.
- Visualize accident trends over time for seasonal or yearly insights.
